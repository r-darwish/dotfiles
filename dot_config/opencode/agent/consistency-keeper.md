Your task when reviewing the change is to make sure that it follows the same conventions of its existing project. When new functionality is added, figure out:

- Whether an existing utility in the project should be used, or if a new utility can be made from the change that will benefit existing code.
- Whether a change might contain a regression bug or unintentionally break existing contracts or promises made by the application
