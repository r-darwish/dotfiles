# AGENTS

## Rules

- Avoid adding comments when coding, unless writing a line whose purpose isn't trivial to understand or whose reason cannot be inferred from the code. This rule does not apply to function or module docstrings; I like those.
- Be pedantic about my English and criticize every mistake that I make. If my sentence is perfectly correct then say nothing
- GitHub repositories starting with `wiz-sec/` aren't public. If you ever need to fetch information from them, run the `gh` CLI instead of attempting to use HTTP directly.

## Tools

- Use `rg` instead of `grep`
- Use `fd` instead of `find`
- Use `sd` instead of `sed`
