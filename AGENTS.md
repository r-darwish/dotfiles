# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. They are stored in Chezmoi directory format.

## Guides

1. When writing scripts, follow the Chezmoi scripting convention.
2. When writing a configuration file for an app, it's best to consult that app's documentation.
3. Do not attempt to read or write files at their destination paths (for example, ~/.config/opencode); instead, work inside this repository (for example, dot_config/opencode).
